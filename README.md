Create a simple HTML file for the layout, CSS file and one or any JavaScript files for the logic. 
Create two JavaScript classes with the following logic: 
1. The first class should create a draggable box in the DOM with “Close” button; 
2. The second class in addition to the features from the first class should add the “expand” button to set the height of the box to the max browser height and “collapse” button to reset the height to the default value. Please make this class inherited from the first one. 
Create two buttons on the page to instantiate these boxes from the first and from the second classes. 

Solution should work in the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and IE browsers. You should don’t use inline styles. Please use corresponding CSS classes in your CSS file. 
You are free to use any 3rd party JS libraries like jQuery, etc.
